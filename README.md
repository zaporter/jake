conversation flow:

System prompt (environment)

After every response, I can regen, like or dislike.

Each like / dislike should ask me why I liked or disliked it.
This information should go into the knowledge-preparation stage

Core idea:
- Jake exists in the context of the operating system, not in the context of our conversation.
- Our conversations will always be relatively short. (either party can end the conversation)

Core tokens:
- End of conversation
- Start of conversation

Jake can ask me questions



Teplate

Main risk: 
I will lose interest. This would be bad.

To solve this, I need to build a timeline and actually follow it and I need small achievable goals.

Tasks:
[ ] 
[ ] Get an orchestration framework ready
[ ] Finetune a model
[X] Download and run LLAMA2

Rough plan:
- Get comfortable running and finetuning models
- Build a small orchestration framework that lets me easily run, finetune, and test running / finetuning.
- Build a small set of templates
- Generate data
- Read the research on agents / finetuning methods (right now it doesn't really matter)
- ... profit?
